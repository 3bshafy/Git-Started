## Helping Commands
To start using Git we first need to know some helping commands that help us manipulate the files like pros,
the main purpose of this repo is to be able to use Git like true masters do not in the ordinary lame way.
That also includes manipulating files, renaming them or even changing the working directory. Will it take 
more time to do that in bash command line? ofcourse it will!!! But you'll look awesome man it's the goal...

### 1-"cd" Command
```sh
$cd [directory] 
```
> Before diving into usage of cd command, it is important to understand  
> what it does. cd command is a built-in command in Bash that is used to  
> change current working directory. When you execute cd command, you are  
> telling shell to change directory that you are currently working in.  
> Here, directory refers to directory that you want to change to. If you  
> do not specify a directory, cd command will take you to your home  
> directory by default.

| Argument | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| No Arguments | Takes you to home directory |
| - | Takes you back to previous working directory |
| dirname | Takes you to specified directory |

`Note: if the directory name contains spaces put it between double qoutes ("") so it is treated as one argument`
